# Columns-replica
Replica of the classic game *Columns*

---

As the description says, this program is a simple, and base implementation of the classic puzzle game *Columns*, created by Jay Geersten
in 1989. I wrote this program as after just 10 weeks of learning Python from the ground up, as a proof of knowledge. The game is fully playable and functional, however there is no "fast-falling" mechanic nor any score, level, or jewels tracker.

This game was built using the open source library PyGame, found here: https://www.pygame.org
