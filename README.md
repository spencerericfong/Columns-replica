# Columns-replica
Replica of the classic game Columns

As the description says, this program is a simple, and base implementation of the classic puzzle game "Columns", created by Jay Geersten
in 1989. I wrote this program during my first programming course in university, but unlike most schoolwork programs this particular one
wasn't completely sanitized nor guided, which is why I am including it on my GitHub. We were provided no code, and only a basic outline for
how the program should be written. The game is fully playable and functional, however there is no "fast-falling" mechanic nor any score
tracker.

This game was built using the open source library PyGame, found here: https://www.pygame.org
